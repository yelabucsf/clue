    "As I researched single-cell differential expression packages, I came across [this paper](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2599-6) which concluded that \"methods developed specifically for scRNAseq data do not show significantly better performance compared to the methods designed for bulk RNAseq data; and methods that consider behavior of each individual gene (not all genes) in calling DE genes outperform the other tools.\" DESeq2 was recommended in that paper, so I apply it here (as I did for the bulk sequencing data)."
