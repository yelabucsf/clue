# clue: Efficient Pooled Single-cell Sequencing

Clue is a framework for efficient single-cell sequencing using genetic multiplexing. Cells from genetically distinct individuals are mixed in multiple pools such that their presence or absence in a given pool is fully deterministic of which individual they come from. Pooling in this fashion and using a genotype-free demultiplexing algorithm obviates the need for orthogonal genotyping to demultiplex data.
